## What is STLonic 

In my opinion, the STL library at first glance tries to reduce the complexities of C style programming, but after working with this library for a while, you will say to yourself, "I wish I had continued with C style and not got involved in all this complexity". We must admit that the STL library in C++ is far more incomplete and complex than other libraries in other languages ​​(for example, C# System libraries).
In my opinion, one of the reasons that keep developers away from learning C++ and hate this language, is the complexity of the standard library.
The standard committee doesn't think about it, why don't we?
I decided to provide a library containing a variety of extensions to cover the shortcomings of the STL library.
STLonic is a header-only and cross-platform library written in C++20 and can be compiled on Windows, Linux and Mac.

## What is the goal

The purpose of this project is simply to facilitate the use of the STL library and to focus the programmer on his main concern, not to get involved with Move semantics, references, pointers, lambda, and any complexity that distracts the programmer from his main goal and concern, and ultimately leads to He hates this language.
Now the languages ​​are moving in the direction of better communication with the assembler, bringing more comfort to the programmer, such as Rust or Carbon or Go, which have recently become very popular.
But unfortunately, the standards committee is only thinking of making things more complicated for programmers. Each standard that is published brings a whole new feature that requires a very long time to learn and how to use all of them and makes this language more complicated than before.

## Why STLonic

Learning modern C++ programming is very challenging for both beginners and advanced C++ programmers. They say a new C++ Standard is released every 3 years. Each iteration of the new C++ standard differs from its predecessors. For example, the C++11 standard is completely different from the C++17 standard, and the C++23 standard (due to be released in 2023) will be very different from the C++20 standard.

Keeping up with the new C++ standard is very difficult for most C++ programmers. Through these extensions, I hope to help my audience learn modern C++ programming with less effort.

And also a part of this library depends on OneTBB library (for parallel programming), which is referenced in the source codes.
